# Akari

Akari is a deduction puzzle played on a grid with black cells (some numbered) and empty cells. Place bulbs so that every empty cell is lit horizontally or vertically until a wall, no two bulbs illuminate each other, and each numbered black cell has exactly that many adjacent bulbs. The challenge is to light the entire board with consistent, logical placements.
